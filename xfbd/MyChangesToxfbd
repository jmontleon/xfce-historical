Added Random Backdrop Facility
==============================

structure of .xfbdrc
--------------------

Second line is now a field containing 0 for a single image or 1 for a list file

Added a List File structure
---------------------------

First line indicates how many files are in list. Individual images follow.

in xfbd.h
---------

added a gtk_widget, random_backdrop - 	this determines whether the file chosen
					is a list (true) or an image (false) 
added a string, filename	    -	this is the ACTUAL filename in the rc 
					file.
added a char iList		    -	'0' File name is an image
					'1' File name is a list
changed prototype for readstr()	    -	added a char* to the prototype to allow
					the random field to be read in
changed prototype for writestr()    -	added a char* to the prototype to allow
					the random field to be written out
added prototype for select_backdrp()-	assigns a file from a list file (first
					argument) to second argument
