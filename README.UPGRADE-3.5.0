READ THIS: IMPORTANT NOTE
=========================

If you're not upgrading from a previous version of XFce, please disregard this
note.

To reflect changes in xfce color management, please run script "xfce_upgrade"
after upgrading (this script is new in xfce-3.5.0).

This will remove $HOME/Desktop/Autostart/xfdefs.py (obsolete in 3.5.0 and later)
and move existing $HOME/.gtkrc to .xfce_bckp/ (required to force xfce to 
update the .gtkrc)

Note this has to be done for all users as these files are local to users'
home directories.

Sorry for any inconvenience that may cause (although the process is painless)

Olivier.
