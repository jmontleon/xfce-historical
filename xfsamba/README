1-FAQs:****************************************

Known bugs?

If the workgroup to be examined has a win95 as master browser, nmblookup will
fail. This is a known bug in win95. To get by this, have smbd and nmbd 
running on a linux box for that workgroup. The linux box will take over as
master browser.

How to install?

Install along with the xfce environment. You require the samba suite
programs smbclient and nmbclient for it to do anything useful, though.

What is SMB? 

That's the network protocol that computers with micros*ft 
OS use.

Why is xfsamba a navigator? 

Because it works like a www navigator. This way 
of cruising through a wind*ws network might be unfamiliar to the wind*ws user,
but xfsamba is not for them. Xfsamba is for un*x/lin*x users. A browser like
xfsamba is closer to the way SMB actually works.

What are some advantages of xfsamba?

It understands netbios machines with names that use latin-1 encodings 
(not common in AngloAmerica, but very common in Europe+LatinAmerica). See
the todo below.
 
The machine on which xfsamba will run does have not to be configured to
be part of any wind*ws workgroup or domain .

t does not try to emulate the look and feel of the wind*ws 
network-neighborhood.

No setup necesary to get it up and running. SMB and NMB need not 
even be running on the host computer (though a working smbclient 
and nmblookup must be in $PATH).



2-Wishlist:**********************************

-1.5: mput and mget (must enable multiple selection) new routines,
      thinking of future d+d
-1.6: recursive put for uploading directories. (recurse set in command line,
      single session, using mput routines).
-1.65:same as above but for downloading.

0:Modify xftree to accept file drops from xfsamba (xfsamba needs to be 
  modified too).

1:Complement the text-dos text-win relationship for other latin-1 languages
  besides Spanish. (functions latin1-readable in xfsamba_mem.c).

2:Put in a progress+cancel dialog for file downloading.

3:Put in an option to pipe a download to an application instead of 
  saving to disk. (problem: application must be stdin pipe enabled).

4:Accept drag and drops from xftree to upload files.

7:Put in a winpopup message sender function.

10:Figure out if a switch from fork() to threads is possible or desireable.


3-BUG checklist****************************************************

Stuff that needs to be checked for bugs:
 * What if the user writes IP in location and this responds with
 * "no status"?
