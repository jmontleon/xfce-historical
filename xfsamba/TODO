CRASH! when pressing copy button in FreeBSD. FIXME.
- buggy when mixed files and directories are dropped or pasted.
-check and eliminate need for latin1 translation routines (no longer necesary
on later versions of samba)
-print by DnD
-cut,copy and paste options
-font (with iconsize) and background color
-bug: gtk in suspended state when waiting for a forked smbumount which is
      pending (mount a share, open a terminal with the xftree, close the
      xftree, this will create condition).
--- in xftree: enable recursive downloading when a directory is dropped there.
