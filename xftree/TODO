- allow for multiple programs to be registered for a single filetype 
- incorporate xfglob results as main level tree entries (or extend
  xfglob to use stuff from xftree, this would be xfglob stuff then)
- In xtree_tar.c, when determining "mode", do a search of all open xfree
  windows until the extracted file is found (tar_extract()) (what ?)
- Toolbar icon + menu elements for "print", and a rootlevel tree (on 
  expanding it you would get a queue list, with options for deleting
  entries, etc.)
- Create a linked list of "cut paths", "copied paths" so as to change
  the icons if the paths happen to be in the way of an update_tree. also,
  the changing of the X pasteboard should cause a update_tree (because of
  the icon story).i.e., changing the Xpastboard caused an update of the
  linked lists cut/copy, which in turn, when changed, causes an update_tree
  event. (what ?) 
- gtk-2

Maybe :
- Enable .deb expansion. (I need a debian box to do the testing first).
- open a "goto desktop", to open the ROX desktop. 
- use hostnames in dnd like rox?
- allow rcp or rsync --rsh=rsh?
- incorporate root level entries for roxy pinboards? a "goto desktop", 
  to open the ROX pinboards?
- a recursive chown, chmod, chgrp for setting properties?
- Toolbar icon + menu elements for "print"

xftree2:
Use nicer icons, like the small ones from nautilus.
examine the way other file managers deal with problem directories (/dev, nfs)
Modulariztion with xfsamba and xfglob.
Top level tree entries: smb, local, glob.
Desireable toplevel entries: rsync, rcp/scp (fish), nfs, smbfs
Plus a rpm/pkg module (also desireable for deb)
good details:
  -location/goto box with dynamic label (like nautilus)
  -icon view is good for dnd directory selection (you can have a tabulated window for examining the interior of directories a-la-xftree. Up to 3 at a time).
  examine the use of /usr/share/nautilus/filesystem_attributes.xml.
