Known bugs:

*Only when extracting from tarfile from one xftree window to a *different* xftree window:
 - If action is move (and tarfile is not compressed), extracted file is deleted but the    ctree is not updated.
 - If action is extract, the created file has mode 0640 instead of the mode of the
   file within the tarfile.

*The entry information of symlinks to directories is that of the directory 
 it points to. Otherwise it is the information of the symlink itself.
 This is because this information is used to determine whether an update
 is necesary. (This will be fixed with a checksum variable for directory 
 changes).

*Symlinks that point to directories are filtered as files, not directories

*Extraction of files with embeded spaces from the inside of tar files will
 fail.

*If multiple instances of xftree are being run, closing one of them will delete
 all temporary files. (They are temporary, after all).
