version 1.11b

* Starts a shell before running a command line

version 1.11

* Removed those ugly zombies processes
* Added writes to config file each time it's modified (that's safer)
* Added special behavior for panel buttons
* Lightly modified to keep the same aspect under xforms v 0.86

version 1.10

So many things !!
* Bug concerning set_font_name under v0.84 of xforms has been removed. (Shame on
  me, that was my fault... Thanks, Dr. T.C. Zhao !)
* Real better and safer signal handling.
* Some parts of the code has been cleaned up.
* No more calls to "system()". So ampersand (&) is not needed anymore in 
  command lines. But don't worry, config files are automatically upgraded.
* For each new run now, the previous config file is saved (under .xfcerc.bak). 
  That's safer !
* Fully configurable... Now, you can define and save your favorite colors ! Try
  it now !! Just click on painter panel !!
* Colors are saved under a different file, so other programs could share those
  colors (That's for contributors, if any...)
* Reduced colors in panel icons : Save colormap allocation...
* New design for the central panel (new icons...).
* The names of screens are not limited to 12 character anymore, but depend on
  the real length of the string (that has to fit in button).
* A brand-new-cute-little icon for all XFCE windows ! Try to iconify XFCE !!
* Version number is now displayed in info box.
* When XFCE encounters a syntax error (or data mismatch error) in the config
  file, it now displays an alert box, so you don't have to switch virtual
  consoles to know what happenned.
* Samples config files for FVWM and FVWM2 have been modified. If you switch 
  screens, now, the background color of the root window changes.
* New directory structure :
  By default, if you don't change Imakefile,
  XFCE has been moved out from /usr/X11/bin to /usr/local/bin.
  XFCE.logo is now in /var/XFCE
  The palettes are in /var/XFCE/palettes, WHICH IS A DIRECTORY THAT CAN BE
  ACCESSED (FOR READ AND WRITE) BY ANY USER. 

version 1.05b

* Some visual enhancements (better contrasts).
* XFCE now includes a man page. Type man XFCE to see it.
* New sample config files for FVWM and FVWM2.

version 1.04

* XFCE should now compile using the brand new version 0.84 of XFORMS. At least,
  It has been modified and tested using test version of XFORMS 0.84.
