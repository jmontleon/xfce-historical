version 2.00 : Here it come, XFWM !

version 1.27

* Use of MWM hints to display XFCE windows on compatible Window Managers
  (I consider this as a major improvement, even if Fvwm95 or Afterstep
  provide terrible support for this -define USEMWMHINTS to 0 to disable
  this improvement ;-)

* New buttons for the front panel
* New icon for Network connections

version 1.24

* Added support for resources
* Added resources definitions for English, French, Italian and German.
* Modified to compile and run under Solaris 2.5.1 (by Nye Liu - nyet@nbase.com)

version 1.23

* Added tips
* Colors handling modified
* XFCE on SunSITE has been moved from /pub/linux/X11/window-managers to 
  /pub/linux/X11/toolbars (what seems quite logical).
* Archive names are now lowercase; that's more UNIX compliant, and that would
  make ftp keepers' life easier !
  XFCE.lsm          -> xfce.lsm
  XFCE-1.2.3.tar.gz -> xfce-1.2.3.tar.gz


version 1.22

* XFCE now can start FVWM's modules (*) ! just start the command line with the
  keyword 'Module ' (*).
  Anyway, this still depends on the syntax of FVWM, which is not the same
  between v1 and v2 !
  eg: Use Module "" FvwmPager 0 3 for Fvwm 1.xx
          Module FvwmPager 0 3    for Fvwm 2.xx
* Now features a handle to move the panel arround (*) !
* Added a close button on the top left corner (*)
* Added an iconify button to the top right corner (*)
* Changed some features to enhance compatibility with future versions of XForms
* Added opaque move of popup menus (*)
* Configuration file is now also searched in /var/XFCE directory. This make
  installation for many users easier, since system administrator just has to
  make one copy of a configuration file in this directory, and all users will
  access it.
* Updated man page
* FVWM and FVWM2 configuration files are now copied to /var/XFCE directory
  so that any user can copy them to his own home directory it or use them 
  directly from the /var/XFCE directory.

(*) = Only works with FVWM and FVWM2, using included .fvwmrc and .fvwm2rc
      configuration files. User needs to update those files by typing :
      cp sample.fvwm2rc ~/.fvwm2rc
      cp sample.fvwmrc ~/.fvwmrc

version 1.21

* New behavior for the front panel buttons : I use an "old fashioned" 
  "press-and-release" behavior, because "temporized" buttons cause troubles to 
  Xlib, and crash XFCE !
* New behavior for popup menus : Added a little thin button at the bottom of the
  menu that "detaches" the menu. This functionnality is better and safer.
  Detachable menus option can still be disabled using the setup dialog.

version 1.20

* New FVWM config files, needed to take real advantage of the following changes.
* Icons on the front panel can be changed. Use the right mouse button for that.
* A lock button has been added, to let you start any X locking program.
* Detachable menus ! Now menus have their own windows, so if you move around a 
  popup menu, it won't close when you select a item (This option can be 
  disabled if you prefer old fashion sticky popup menus without border).
  You can even iconified them !  
* Real better interaction with FVWM and other modules : XFCE keep listening
  to FVWM, and accordingly presses buttons when another module switches desk.
  XFCE is really a cooperative module now !
* XFCE repaints root window with the color corresponding. No need to use 
  "FvwmBacker" module anymore (anyway, this option can be disabled if you prefer
  using your own backdrops - such as xbackdrop)
* New windows behavior : XFCE does not quit when you close'em.
* XFCE has been successfully tested with most popular window managers like
  TWM, FVWM95 and MWM 2.0. Note that virtual screens work with FVWM95, since
  it uses FVWM message format.

version 1.11b

* Starts a shell before running a command line

version 1.11

* Removed those ugly zombies processes
* Added writes to config file each time it's modified (that's safer)
* Added special behavior for panel buttons
* Lightly modified to keep the same aspect under xforms v 0.86

version 1.10

So many things !!
* Bug concerning set_font_name under v0.84 of xforms has been removed. (Shame on
  me, that was my fault... Thanks, Dr. T.C. Zhao !)
* Real better and safer signal handling.
* Some parts of the code has been cleaned up.
* No more calls to "system()". So ampersand (&) is not needed anymore in 
  command lines. But don't worry, config files are automatically upgraded.
* For each new run now, the previous config file is saved (under .xfcerc.bak). 
  That's safer !
* Fully configurable... Now, you can define and save your favorite colors ! Try
  it now !! Just click on painter panel !!
* Colors are saved under a different file, so other programs could share those
  colors (That's for contributors, if any...)
* Reduced colors in panel icons : Save colormap allocation...
* New design for the central panel (new icons...).
* The names of screens are not limited to 12 character anymore, but depend on
  the real length of the string (that has to fit in button).
* A brand-new-cute-little icon for all XFCE windows ! Try to iconify XFCE !!
* Version number is now displayed in info box.
* When XFCE encounters a syntax error (or data mismatch error) in the config
  file, it now displays an alert box, so you don't have to switch virtual
  consoles to know what happenned.
* Samples config files for FVWM and FVWM2 have been modified. If you switch 
  screens, now, the background color of the root window changes.
* New directory structure :
  By default, if you don't change Imakefile,
  XFCE has been moved out from /usr/X11/bin to /usr/local/bin.
  XFCE.logo is now in /var/XFCE
  The palettes are in /var/XFCE/palettes, WHICH IS A DIRECTORY THAT CAN BE
  ACCESSED (FOR READ AND WRITE) BY ANY USER. 

version 1.05b

* Some visual enhancements (better contrasts).
* XFCE now includes a man page. Type man XFCE to see it.
* New sample config files for FVWM and FVWM2.

version 1.04

* XFCE should now compile using the brand new version 0.84 of XFORMS. At least,
  It has been modified and tested using test version of XFORMS 0.84.
