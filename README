Welcome to XFCE !
-----------------


* XFCE is an X toolbar that allows user to easily launch programs.

* It uses the XForm library from T.C Zhao and Mark Overmars (at least version
  0.81) to display 3D widget.

* It's very easy to use and configure.

* XFCE is designed to work with FVWM, so it can switch desks. But it also
  works without FVWM. In this case, some functionalities won't be available,
  but still, XFCE works fine without FVWM.

Special thanks
--------------

Thanks to Giorgio Marzano (marzano@inf.uniroma3.it) for translating the
resource file in italian and to Carsten Meyer (carsten.meyer@hamburg.roses.de)
for the german translation.

Of course, deep thanks to Dr. T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars for the XFORMS
library. Special thanks to T.C. Zhao who has always replyed (quickly) to 
my mails !!

Deep thanks go to Joel Bernier (kheops@moe.acticiel.com), who has made his 
Web site the official XFCE's site.

I would like to thank Rob Nation for FVWM. Some parts of this program
(especially the part of XFCE that communicate with FVWM) are based on his 
work.

I would also thank Roman Mitnitski for Tycoon, I've taken a look at his work
before I first started writing XFCE (I've never used XFORMS before)


Note to CDROM vendors and distribution makers
---------------------------------------------

Please feel free to include XFCE in your distributions/CDROMs. Just drop me
a mail to let me know (fourdan@compuserve.com)


Bug reports and comments
------------------------

If you use and appreciate XFCE, send me a mail at 106701.3026@compuserve.com
or else fourdan@compuserve.com (Olivier Fourdan) - I need support -.
If you encounter problems, or if you want to submit enhancements, or just make
a bug report, send it to the address above.

  
What about XFCE and FVWM ?
--------------------------

Version 1.20 and later (I guess) are closer to FVWM and keep on communicating
with the window manager (If launched as a module, of course). Unfortunately,
versions 1.xx and 2.xx of FVWM are not compatible, because message format has
changed. So, now XFCE needs the real source distributions of FVWM to access
the right data structure of messages sent by FVWM.

Please edit the Imakefile and change the source tree for FVWM_SRC and FVWM2_SRC.
I believe that if you have both source trees (like I do), you still prefer 
version 2.xx of FVWM, so this source tree will be placed first in search order
for header files.

For those who do not have source trees of FVWM (anyway, it's free and publicly
available), there is one copy of FVWM 2.xx header file shipped with XFCE. This
file is provided in case, but be aware that might not be up to date, and so not
compatible with your version of FVWM.

If you encounter problems with screens buttons, especially if buttons do not
press down by themselves when you switch desks with another module (like 
FvwmPager, for example) that's probably due to a message data mismatch. In this
case, get the source tree for your version of FVWM and recompile XFCE. Note that
will never hang the program, it's is not a bug, and it's painless !


How to get the XForms library ?
-------------------------------

XFCE works with the XForms library from T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars. To compile
and run it, you'll need at least version 0.81 of XForms. Since the authors of
this library do not allow the distribution of the library "bundled" with other
software, and avoid distribution for commercial use, you cannot get it with
commercial CDROMS.
So it's up to you to download the library directly from the original site.

To download the XForms library, connect to :

  http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms
  
If you have questions about XForms, contact T.C. Zhao at
  
  zhao@bloch.phys.uwm.edu

Documentation on XForms is available from einstein.phys.uwm.edu /pub/xforms
via anonymous ftp.

The entire XForms distribution plus the latest info is accessible via
http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms
