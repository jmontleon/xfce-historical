Welcome to XFCE !
-----------------


* XFCE is an X toolbar that allows user to easily launch programs.

* It uses the XForm library from T.C Zhao and Mark Overmars (at least version
  0.81) to display 3D widget.

* It's very easy to use and configure.

* XFCE now feature its own Window Manager. But it also works without. 
  In this case, some functionalities won't be available, but still, XFCE 
  works fine.

How to get the XForms library ?
-------------------------------

XFCE works with the XForms library from T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars. To compile
and run it, you'll need at least version 0.81 of XForms. Since the authors of
this library do not allow the distribution of the library "bundled" with other
software, and avoid distribution for commercial use, you cannot get it with
commercial CDROMS.
So it's up to you to download the library directly from the original site.

To download the XForms library, connect to :

  http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms
  
If you have questions about XForms, contact T.C. Zhao at
  
  zhao@bloch.phys.uwm.edu

Documentation on XForms is available from einstein.phys.uwm.edu /pub/xforms
via anonymous ftp.

The entire XForms distribution plus the latest info is accessible via
http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms
