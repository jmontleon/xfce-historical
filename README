Welcome to XFCE !
-----------------


* XFCE is an X toolbar that allows user to easily launch programs.

* It uses the XForm library from T.C Zhao and Mark Overmars (at least version
  0.81) to display 3D widget.

* It's very easy to use and configure.

* XFCE is designed to work with FVWM, so it can switch desks. But it also
  works without FVWM. In this case, you won't be able to switch screens.

Special thanks
--------------

Of course, deep thanks to Dr. T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars for the XFORMS
library. Special thanks to T.C. Zhao who has allways replyed (quickly) to 
my mails !!

I would like to thank Rob Nation for FVWM. Some parts of this program
(especially the part of XFCE that communicate with FVWM) are based on his 
work.

I would also thank Roman Mitnitski for Tycoon, I've taken a look at his work
before I first started writing XFCE (I've never used XFORMS before)

Note to CDROM vendors and distribution makers

How to compile and install ?
----------------------------

IMPORTANT : YOU NEED TO HAVE A ROOT ACCESS TO INSTALL XFCE PROPERLY
DRIRECTORY STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED SINCE VERSION 1.10 - READ CAREFULLY
FILE "NEW" FOR MORE INFORMATION.

1) Untar source :

	$ tar xvzf XFCE111.tgz; cd XFCE
	
2) Edit Imakefile to suits your system

	$ vi Imakefile

3) Create Makefile :

	$ xmkmf
	
If you don't have Imake installed, then you can try with the one shipped in
the package or get the makefile that someone else used for your platform, 
or even better, get Imake from ftp.x.org !

4) Compile :

	$ make
	
If you have a poor 256 colors vga adaptator (just like me), you might want to 
install the "dithered" version of XFCE. The full color version might allocate
all the colors, so your system may not be able to display other programs
properly.

5) To install full color version, type :

	$ make install
or
	$ make install_full
	
   To install dithered version, type :

	$ make install_dithered
	
This would install XFCE so it can run from command line.

But if you want XFCE to be able to take advantage of FVWM virtual screen 
capabilty, you need to start XFCE as an FVWM module.

To do so, create a symbolic link from XFCE executable to FVWM modules 
directory :

	$ ln -s /usr/X11/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/
 or, if you're using FVWM 2.xx,
	$ ln -s /usr/X11/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/

Change styles to make XFCE appear sticky, without border :

	Style "*XFCE*"     NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, BorderWidth 5

Then, change your init function in fvwm config file (usualy .fvwmrc) to
automatiocally start XFCE :

Function "InitFunction"
	Module	"I"	XFCE
	Desk	"I"	0 4
EndFunction

You might add XFCE to your module list, also :

	Module  "XFCE"		XFCE

See FVWM config file examples shipped with XFCE for more details.
