xfce (3.1.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Somebody wants to take it over officially 
    maintaining it for Debian?
  * Removed "xfce_{setup,remove}" and replaced it with a systemwide
    startup wrapper script "xfce_start".  No need to touch already 
    existing ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession files anymore.
