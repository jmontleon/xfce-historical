xfce (3.4.0.20000513-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Depends on GTK+ now (no more XForms!) and thus moves to main.
  * Maintainer set to the QA Group, because Kevin Donnelly agreed that
    someone should adopt it (if anyone's interested, speak up!).
  * debian/* now based on Paul Seelig's upstream debian/* dir, polished
    up by me, converted to debhelper. Fully updated for Policy 3.1.1.
  * Moved executables to /usr/bin in the binary package. Removed sample
    files that don't differ from upstream, i.e. left only xfcolors (BTW it
    wasn't being read anyway, I had to modify source to read it).
  * Changed source files that read their configuration files from
    XFCE_DIR (/usr/share/xfce) to do it from a new define, XFCE_CONFDIR
    (/etc/X11/xfce). Removed "sample." or "system." prefix from each of
    them and modified whatever needed to use that. [accepted upstream]
  * There no longer a xfce-common package, added Conflicts:/Replaces with it.
  * Fixed conffiles to use absolute paths. I don't know what to do with the
    the language/charset-specific config files.
  * Fixed po/Makefile.in.in to install under $(DESTDIR). [already upstream]
  * Removed executable bit from config files (why was it there anyway?!).
    Made checking ~/Desktop/Autostart redirect stderr to /dev/null, in case
    the directory doesn't even exist (is that some GNOME thing, anyway?).
  * Added a sentence to postinst saying startxfce should be used either from
    command line or from ~/.xsession to actually start XFce.
  * Removed xfce_start, startxfce can do everything that script did.
  * Moved HTML help files under /usr/share/doc/xfce/html and set a symlink
    from /usr/share/xfce/help to it. Added a small chunk of code to postinst
    to handle that on upgrades (dpkg doesn't overwrite directories with
    symlinks).
  * Removes configuration directory on purge.
  * Added undocumented(7) symlinks.
  * Fixed description in the control file :o)
  * Added stuff used by various XF* applets to Suggests: field.
  * Updated README.debian and renamed it to README.Debian.
