 * A bombproof version of doprnt (dopr) included.
 * Sigh.  This sort of thing is always nasty do deal with.  Note that
 * the version here does not include floating point...
 *
 * snprintf() is used instead of sprintf() as it does limit checks
 * for string length.  This covers a nasty loophole.
 *
 * The other functions are there to prevent NULL pointers from
 * causing nast effects.
