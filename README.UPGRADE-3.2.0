READ THIS: IMPORTANT NOTE
=========================

If you're not upgrading from a previous version of XFce, please disregard this
note.

Due to the changes in the directory structure (ie XFce files are now located in
/usr/share/xfce/ instead of /var/XFCE as it was until version 3.2.0), the 
configuration files created by previous versions of XFce may get inaccurate.

Ths simplest way to avoid problems after upgrading to XFce 3.2.0 is to 
link /var/XFCE to /usr/share/xfce (this should be done before starting XFce)

To do so, remove the previous files :

	rm -R /var/XFCE

and link the new directory to /var/XFCE :

	ln -s /usr/share/xfce /var/XFCE

By doing so, all previous configuration files that point to the previous 
directory structure will stay usable (icons, backdrops, sounds, etc.)

Olivier.
