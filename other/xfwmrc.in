# Gimp 1.0.x is like that : It keeps asking for its main
# window to be placed at (0,0) for no reason. This can
# be annoying when using Xinerama. For this kind of application,
# you can use the flag "Authorize_Translate" that tells xfwm 
# to translate the coordonates to the current screen even if the 
# application asked for a specific location.
