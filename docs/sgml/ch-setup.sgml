<title>Setup Dialog</title>

<para>
As stated before, XFce is very intuitive. All customization can be 
performed through its graphical user interface. For this purpose XFce
provides a setup dialog with 4 tabfolders :
</para>

  <listitem><para>XFce</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Windows</para></listitem>

<para>
Since XFce is based on the popular GTK+ toolkit, it uses the .gtkrc style
hidden configuration file located in the user's home directory. This 
enables all GTK+ applications to share the same color scheme.
</para>

<para>
While .gtkrc is usually copied from a theme or written by hand, XFce is 
able to automatically generate the .gtkrc file from the color values and 
font selected by the user in the palette setup screen.
</para>

<para>
XFce is able to determine whether the .gtkrc file is customized by the 
user or not. If one wants to build his own .gtkrc style or if one uses a 
style from GNOME Control Center (gnomecc), XFce won't override it (as a 
result, if you curently have a .gtkrc file in your home directory and you 
want XFce to manage the style for you, you should remove or rename your 
current ~/.gtkrc file). But if there is no .gtkrc file in user's home 
directory or if it is empty, XFce will generate a .gtkrc file so all GTK+
applications, including GNOME applications, will share exactly the same 
look.
</para>

<para>
A palette, from XFce's point of view, is made of 8 colors and a font name.
Each color is used to display specific items in the XFce desktop, like the
mouse pointer, the default window background, the text fields, etc. The 
color you select for this palette are shared by all XFce aware applications
(XFTree, XFClock,XFwm, etc.).
</para>

<para>
By clicking on one of the colors, you can change it using the color 
selector. The palette can be saved to disk using the "Save..." button.
You can retrieve it later using the "Load..." button. You don't necessarily
need to save your palette to disk unless you want to share it with other 
users. The current palette is automatically saved to a file in the user's
home directory so that XFce will have the same color scheme when you 
restart it.
</para>

<para>
In this tabfolder you can also choose a GTK engine to use. XFce can try to
make other application use the xfce color scheme. You can activate this by 
selecting the option "apply colors to all applications".
</para>

<para>
The font used for displaying text in XFce is selected in the XFce tabfolder.
</para>

    The option "repaint root window" overrides any other application
    trying to use the root window. As a result, if you specify a

    this option.

<para>
This tabfolder is for managing options for XFwm, the window manager. The
behavior of the windows can be tuned by using the following options :
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
  Click to focus windows : If you enable this option, you will have
  to click inside a window to give it the keyboard focus. Otherwise
  the keyboard focus will be given to the window below the mouse
  pointer. If you move the pointer the focus moves accordingly.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  When Autoraise window is enabled (this option is not available if
  "Click to focus" is enabled) the windows with keyboard focus are
  automatically raised, i.e. placed on top of all other windows.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  Show contents of windows during move/resize defines whether the
  whole window or just an outline shadow should be shown during
  move/resize operations. The outline shadow (ie if this option is
  not selected) gives additional informations about the window
  position and geometry. Please note that opaque move and resize can
  load your system or your network if using Xfce on a remote X
  terminal, by causing a lot of window exposure events.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  The title bar of the active window can be painted using a solid or
  a gradient color. Just select "Use gradient color for active window" 
  to use a gradient color.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  Window border style. XFce provides a number of window themes.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  Set the size of the snap grid for windows. Window snapping is a
  very convenient feature : When a window is moved such that it
  touches another window or the screen edge it holds that position
  for a moment. Using this feature, you can align windows quite
  easily by just moving them till they hold then releasing them.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  "Snapsize" option also drives the autodesk switch feature. By
  setting a snapsize lower or equal to 5, the autodesk switch is
  disabled.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  XFwm automatically arranges the iconified windows on the screen.
  You can specify where to place the icons by selecting top, left,
  bottom or right.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
  The 3 last fields are for changing the fonts used by the window
  manager, for titles, icons and menus respectively.
  </para></listitem>

(daemons/services) you want to start when XFce starts. For example, if you
don't want the pager to be launched on startup, just unselect the option. 
Beware that if a module is not started, the corresponding feature won't be 
enabled : If you don't start xfsound, you won't get any sound in XFce.
