<title>Advanced XFwm configuration</title>

<partintro>

<para>
If you want to customize xfwm behaviour beyond what is possible in the
setup dialog, or if for some reason you run xfwm without the panel (put 
the command <command>xfwm -noxfce</command> in your 
<filename>$HOME/.xinitrc</filename> file if you want this), you have to 
read this part of the book. It involves editing a text configuration file
in the good old unix tradition.
</para>

<para>
The first step to customize your xfwm configuration is to copy the
sample configuration file to the your 
<filename role="directory">$HOME/.xfce</filename> directory. The
location of this file depends on the compilation options. When compiling
from source <filename role="directory">/usr/local/etc/xfce</filename> is
the default. For the binary packages this file can be found in 
<filename role="directory">/etc/X11/xfce</filename>.

<prompt> $ </prompt><command>cp</command> <replaceable
>/etc/X11/xfce/xfwmrc</replaceable> <filename role="directory"
>$HOME/.xfce</filename>
</programlisting>

<para>
The configuration file contains commands for xfwm. The configuration 
system is very flexible and has many options, but as a consequence it can 
be rather complex.
