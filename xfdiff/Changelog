* changes xfdiff 1.2.8:
  follow symlinks
  some other modifications: gtk-2.0 option not compiling 
  because the modifications have not been added for gtk2

* changes xfdiff 1.2.7:
  modified the patch file parser to take non unified format,
  in particular, Mosix patches to the kernel.

* changes xfdiff 1.2.6:
- Put in a vpane for diagnostics (xfdiff_diag.c no longer used)
- Put in directive for gtk+2.0 : 
   drag+drop, fontselector (gtk bug), 
   higlighted text color, wheel hack, xfcestyle (not using xfce-init?)
   maybe some more stuff I haven't noticed.
makefile for gtk2.0 (this will later be removed from this file):

------------------------------------------------------------------------


* changes xfdiff 1.2.4:
- fixed a bug that made xfdiff-patch fail when viewing linux kernel patches

* changes xfdiff 1.2.3:

 - Several bugs fixed (resizing, diff'ing directories, binary files, etc.)
 - Source code reorganized.
 - More command line options.
 - Xfdiff now lives in a separate directory.
 - Modal dialogs now linked from ../libs/xfce-common.c 

 - Line synchronization option added.
 - Diff/Patch toggle added
 - Auto set strip level option added
 - Menubar enhanced but simplified.
 - All "input paths" can now be dragged and dropped.

New texts:
	"Include subdirectories?"
	"Include binary files?"
	"Line synchronization enabled.\n"
	"Line synchronization disabled.\n"
	"****Binary data****\n"
	"Reversed patch detected. Should I try reversing it?"
	"Switch to patch mode"
	"Switch to diff mode"
	"Use line synchronization voids"
	"Patch options only active in patch-mode"
	"Automatic strip level"

Corrected texts:
	"View differences" (was "Do diff")
	"View differences in new" (was "Do diff in new")
	"Next difference" (was "Next diff")
	"Previous difference" (was "Prev diff")
	"Previous file" (was "Prev file")
	"View patch created differences" (was "Do patch")
	"View patch created differences in new" (was "Do patch in new")
	"Apply patch to Hard Drive" (was "Apply patch")
	"Undo patch to Hard Drive" (was "Undo patch")
	"No file was found for patching\nEither the directory to apply patch is not correctly selected\nor an incorrect strip level was used.\n"
		(was "[...] (default -p0)\n")  

Obliterated texts:
	"Press do_diff button again to see changes.\n" 
	"No right file has been selected."
	"No left file has been selected."
	"That is a directory (or symlink)"

 *  todo (maybe):
- add option to interrupt a running "diff"
