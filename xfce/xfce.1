.SH DESCRIPTION
xfce is an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure toolbar for X11. 
Features pulldown menus with color icons, 3D widgets, etc. 
It's designed to work with XFwm, (window manager shipped with xfce)
.PP
xfce requires an X-based workstation or X-Terminal.  If you
have used telnet or rlogin to access the host system, set
the Unix environment variable for your display:
.PP
% export DISPLAY devicename:0
.PP
.PP
When you first start xfce, it creates an empty configuration file (.xfce3rc)
in your home directory.
.PP
Of course, nothing is defined, so, menus are empty. To add a new file in a menu,
first open it by clicking on the little arrow. then choose "Add icon...", and
fill out all fields (command, pixmap and label).
.PP
You can also drag programs onto the "Add icon..." button to easily add entries 
to the corresponding menu.
.PP
Modification and removal of existing items in menus can be performed with the 
right mouse button.
.PP
To define programs associated with the icons on the panel, use the right mouse button.
Enter the command line and press "enter" to validate. Press "escape" to cancel.
You can also choose the icon to be displayed on the front panel. Click on the down 
arrow and choose a category (Files related, Terminal connections, Writting/text tools, etc.)
.PP
Drag and Drop is also supported. You can drag files from XFTree (file manager 
shipped with xfce) or any other GTK+ based filemanager (GNOME included) and
drop it onto the panel to start the corresponding application with the files 
dragged.
.PP
To change the name of screens, just click on button with right mouse button.

.SH PREDEFINED KEYWORDS
.PP
A number of applications shipped with xfce/XFwm must cooperate closely with the window
manager. Those applications are called "modules" and must be started from xfwm
itself or from xfce.
In order to start XFwm's modules, xfce has to be started as a module itself 
(This is the default unless you've started xfce from the command line). 
.PP
Use the keyword
.I
Module
to indicate that your command has to be considered as a module. Then enter 
your command, just like you would do in XFwm's configuration file.
.PP
.PP
Example : To start the module xfpager, use
.PP
.nf
.sp
Module xfpager
.sp
.fi
.PP
Some other applications, basically console text based applications cannot be 
started as an X application directly (this may cause the X server to hang)
.PP
For this, xfce provides the keyword 
.I
Term
to indicate that xfce has to start a terminal first to be able to execute the
command.
.PP
.PP
Example : To start the program vi, use
.PP
.nf
.sp
Term vi
.sp
.fi
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
