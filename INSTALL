How to compile and install ?
----------------------------

IMPORTANT : YOU NEED TO HAVE A ROOT ACCESS TO INSTALL XFCE PROPERLY
DRIRECTORY STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED SINCE VERSION 1.10 - READ CAREFULLY
FILE "NEW" FOR MORE INFORMATIONS.


1) Untar source :

	$ tar xvzf xfce-2.0.?.tar.gz; cd xfce-2.0.?
(replace the question tag by the right release version)
	
2) Edit Imakefile to suit your system (this is quite important, don't miss
   this point !)

	$ vi Imakefile

3) Create Makefile :

	$ xmkmf
	
If you don't have Imake installed, then you can try with the one shipped in
the package or get the makefile that someone else used for your platform, 
or even better, get Imake from ftp.x.org !

4) Build the Makefiles :
  
	$ make Makefiles

5) Compile :

	$ make
	

5) Install :

	$ make install

6) Start setup script

	$ xfce_setup

7) Choose your default language

Define the environment variable XFCE_LANG to use the language of your choice :

	$ export XFCE_LANG="fr"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="en"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="it"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="de"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="hu"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="es"
	$ export XFCE_LANG="sk"
