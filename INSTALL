1) Requirements
===============

To compile and run XFce 3.x, you'll need :
* gtk+ 1.2.x
* glib 1.2.x
* libXpm 4.x
* gcc

XFce can make use of the following, if available :
* Imlib
* libpng
* libjpeg
* libgif (or libungif)
* libtiff

2) Configuration and Compilation 
================================

2.1) For those upgrading from previous versions of XFce :
---------------------------------------------------------

./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --datadir=/var --sysconfdir=/var
make
make install-strip

Note: 'make install-strip' may not work on all OS. You might choose to use
'make install' and strip programs manually afterwards to save memory and disk
space.

2.2) If you want to stay in the GNU spirit :
--------------------------------------------

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --datadir=/usr/local/share --sysconfdir=/etc/X11
make
make install

You can override compilation option regarding XFCE_DIR (usually $datadir/xfce/)
by setting the environment variable XFCE_DATA

Eg.:

export XFCE_DATA=/usr/local/share; xfce

If you are using a system with CDE installed, you can also specify --enable-dt 
at configure time. This will set up some dtlogin resource files in /etc/dt
to add an entry for XFce in dtlogin.

This will copy some configurations files to /usr/dt/config in order to dtlogin
to be able to display XFce in the list of default sessions available.

Eg.:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --datadir=/usr/local/share --enable-dt

If you have Imlib installed on your system, but you don't want XFce to make
use of it (ie fallback to standard Xpm support), specify --enable-imlib=no and 
--enable-gdk-pixbuf=no at configuration time.

Eg.:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --datadir=/usr/local/share \
 --enable-imlib=no --enable-gdk-pixbuf=no


3) User setup
=============

XFce provides 2 convenient scripts for easy installation/configuration of XFce.

Run xfce_setup to set up replacement files in user's home directory. These files
will fire up xfwm and xfce every time the user starts an X session 
(through startx or through xdm).

The previous configurations files are saved in a hidden directory .xfce_bckp/

Afterwards, one can use xfce_remove to restore the previous files.

As XFce supports Native Language Supports (NLS), make sure the environment 
variable LANG is correctly set for your country.

E.g.:
bash : 	export LANG="fr"
csh : 	setenv LANG "fr"
