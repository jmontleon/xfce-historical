How to compile and install ?
----------------------------

IMPORTANT : YOU NEED TO HAVE A ROOT ACCESS TO INSTALL XFCE PROPERLY
DRIRECTORY STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED SINCE VERSION 1.10 - READ CAREFULLY
FILE "NEW" FOR MORE INFORMATIONS.


1) Untar source :

	$ tar xvzf XFCE-1.2.?.tar.gz; cd XFCE-1.2.?
(replace the question tag by the right release version)
	
2) Edit Imakefile to suit your system (this is quite important, don't miss
   this point !)

	$ vi Imakefile

3) Create Makefile :

	$ xmkmf
	
If you don't have Imake installed, then you can try with the one shipped in
the package or get the makefile that someone else used for your platform, 
or even better, get Imake from ftp.x.org !

4) Compile :

	$ make
	
If you have a poor 256 colors vga adaptator (just like me), you might want to 
install the "dithered" version of XFCE. The full color version might allocate
all the colors, so your system may not be able to display other programs
properly.

5) To install full color version, type :

	$ make install
   or
	$ make install_full
	
   To install dithered version, type :

	$ make install_dithered
	
This would install XFCE so it can run from command line.

6) Choose your default language

   Type the one of the following lines :
	
	$ make english
	
	$ make francais
	
	$ make italiano

	$ make deutsch

6) Start Fvwm using the right configuration file

    From an X console, type (according that NO other window manager is running)

	$ fvwm -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwmrc
    or
	$ fvwm2 -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwm2rc

    If you get an error message that looks like "<<ERROR>> another WM is 
    running", then you must quit the window manager that is currently running, 
    since only one window manager can be running at a time.

7) Make XFCE and FVWM start automatically

    Edit your .xinitrc file (or whaterver else you use at X startup) and make 
    fvwm start with XFCE's files :

    Add the following lines to your .xinitrc file :

	fvwm -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwmrc

    or, for those who prefer FVWM 2 : 

	fvwm2 -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwm2rc

This is the simpliest way; everything else needed has been set up by the instal-
-lation procedure.


For those who like the hard way, it is also possible to do things by hand. 

This method could be usefull if you wish to keep your own configuration files;
you'll need to edit them to add some new lines to make use of XFCE's 
capabilities.

Installation procedure should have created a link form the XFCE executable to 
the FVWM modules directory. In case this link is missing, create it :

	$ ln -s /usr/X11/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/
	
If you have chosen the local directory as base directory, type :
	
	$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/

or, if you're using FVWM 2.xx,
	
	$ ln -s /usr/X11/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/

If you have chosen the local directory as base directory, type :

	$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/XFCE /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2/

Now edit your .fvwmrc (or .fvwm2rc) file with your favorite text editor,
and change styles to make XFCE appear sticky, without border :

	Style "*XFCE*"     NoTitle, NoHandles, Sticky, BorderWidth 5

Then, change your init function to automatically start XFCE as a module when
FVWM starts up:

Function "InitFunction"
	Module	"I"	XFCE
	Desk	"I"	0 4
EndFunction

You might add XFCE to your module list, also :

	Module  "XFCE"		XFCE

See FVWM config file examples shipped with XFCE for more details.

Once again, those files can be found by any user in the /var/XFCE directory.

Users can start fvwm and fvwm2 by simply typing :

fvwm -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwmrc

or

fvwm2 -f /var/XFCE/sample.fvwm2rc

This is also true for .xfcerc file. XFCE now searches for this file in :

1) A file named .xfcerc in user's home directory
2) /var/XFCE/.xfcerc
3) /var/XFCE/sample.xfcerc

This will make system administrator's life easier I guess ! Copy a "template"
of this file once, and many users access it.
