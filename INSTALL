1) Configuration and Compilation 
================================

1.1) For those upgrading from previous versions of XFce :
---------------------------------------------------------

./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6 --datadir=/var
make
make install-strip

1.2) If you want to stay in the GNU spirit :
--------------------------------------------

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --datadir=/usr/local/share
make
make install-strip

You can override compilation option regarding XFCE_DIR (usually $datadir/XFCE/)
by setting the environment variable XFCE_DATA

Eg.:

export XFCE_DATA=/usr/local/share; xfce

If you are using a system with CDE installed, you can also specify --enable-dt 
at configure time.

This will copy some configurations files to /usr/dt/config in order to dtlogin
to be able to display XFce in the list of default sessions available.

Eg.:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --datadir=/usr/local/share --enable-dt

2) User setup
=============

XFce provides 2 convenient scripts for easy installation/configuration of XFce.

Run xfce_setup to set up replacement files in user's home directory. These files
will fire up xfwm and xfce every time the user starts an X session 
(through startx or through xdm).

The previous configurations files are saved in a hidden directory .xfce_bckp/

Afterwards, one can use xfce_remove to restore the previous files.

As XFce supports Native Language Supports (NLS), make sure the environment 
variable LANG is correctly set for your country.

E.g.:
bash : 	export LANG="fr"
csh : 	setenv LANG "fr"
