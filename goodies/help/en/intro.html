<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>XFCE is a set of applications for the X Window System, including a
Toolbar, a Window Manager and a Backdrop Manager, designed to provide an
easy way to launch other applications of your choice and manage your working
environment.

<P>There is a lot of different toolbars on X, and XFCE is yet another one,
but XFCE is really easy to use and configure.

<P>Unlike many other programs on X Window, XFCE is entirely configurable
with the mouse. No need to learn special syntax before writing a configuration
file, XFCE does it itself !

<P>XFCE has a nice 3D look, and provides an interface to XFwm, the XFCE's
Window Manager.

<P>XFCE acts with XFwm just like one of its modules, and communicates with
it through a UNIX pipe. In order to initiate this pipe, XFCEis automatically
lauched by XFwm on startup. If you wish to know more about the interactions
between XFCE and XFwm, and how to configure the Window Manager, refer to
sections "<A HREF="desktop.html#TOP">Your desktop with XFCE</A>" and "<A HREF="xfwm.html#TOP">XFwm,
XFce's Window Manager</A>" .
